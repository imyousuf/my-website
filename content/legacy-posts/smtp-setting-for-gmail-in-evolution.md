This post of mine involves the least technical depth probably :), it is mainly about configuring SMTP for GMail with Evolution mail client (not that it could not be figured from the image). As GMail users know GMail does not use the default SMTP port (25), the custom port number has to be mentioned in the configuration and though there is no field labelled as Port, but users can easily set the port number as I did. Please see the red border region for it in the image - server-address:port. If required port number can also be provided in similar fashion for incoming mail server.
