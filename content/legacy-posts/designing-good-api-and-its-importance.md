Recently I took a technical session on "Designing Good API and its importance" at BASIS SoftExpo 2012. I was introduced to this topic by Tech Talk of Joshua Bloch and my presentation is heavily influenced by his talk and a humble tribute to his great, inspiring, motivating and illuminating session. The slides are as follows:
