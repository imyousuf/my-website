For sometime I have been searching for a combination for Multi-Module project development with SCM and Project Build tool. After using and testing some tools I have settled [GIT](http://git.or.cz/) and Maven; actually honestly speaking I have quite [impressed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) by GIT. Though the main repository for my projects will be either CVS and SVN because dev.java.net provides those only but the developers will be requested/encouraged to use GIT ([through online collab](http://repo.or.cz/)) as their local/team SCM/VCS. As result of my conviction I have decided to start a plugin for GIT-NetBeans integration as well; Almighty willing. At first I will use it for the [DatabaseReport](https://databasereport.dev.java.net/) and [JAIN SIP adapter](https://jain-sip-api-adapter.dev.java.net/) projects. Everyone interested can join in any of the 3 projects (including the GIT-NetBeans Plugin).
