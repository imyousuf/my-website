I am Imran M Yousuf (hence the initials IMY) and I have used the nick `imyousuf` wherever possible.

Professionally I am a Software Engineer and serving as the VP of Engineering for [NewsCred](https://newscred.com). I have been at NewsCred since June 2014. Prior to that I had been an entrepreneur in e-Commerce Platform as a Service space. And even prior to that I was working in the Content Management System space with [escenic](http://www.escenic.com/). I started my professional software career working in the services industry.

I have been lucky to work with customers and team mates from all continents of the world! That leads me to one of my hobbies traveling and photography. In addition I am a movie addict, I love reading books - both printed and on Kindle.

This blog is for tech enthusiast that I am.
